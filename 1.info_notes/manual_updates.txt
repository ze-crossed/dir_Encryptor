This file lists the most useful things you might want to change manually.
For each item, you can open file_Encryptor.py and edit the lines described.

1) Default encrypted file extension
   - Where: in function encrypt_directory(), the part that checks/sets ".enc".
     - Around lines 50–54 in file_Encryptor.py.
   - What it does:
     - Makes sure the encrypted file name ends with ".enc".
   - How to change:
     - Replace ".enc" with another extension, e.g. ".parrot" or ".secure".

2) Default encrypted file name when you leave it blank
   - Where: also in encrypt_directory(), where it sets:
     - output_name = directory.name + ".enc"
   - What it does:
     - Uses the folder name and adds ".enc" when you don't type a custom name.
   - How to change:
     - Change this line to add a prefix or suffix, for example:
       - "encrypted_" + directory.name + ".enc"

3) Menu text and language
   - Where: in main_menu(), handle_encrypt(), and handle_decrypt().
   - What it does:
     - Controls all messages shown to the user (titles, prompts, errors).
   - How to change:
     - You can translate or rewrite the strings to your preferred language.
     - Look for lines that use print(...) or input(...).

4) Password rules
   - Where: in prompt_password().
   - What it does:
     - Currently requires non‑empty passwords and that confirmation matches.
   - How to change:
     - Add extra checks if you want:
       - Minimum length (for example, at least 8 characters).
       - Must contain numbers or special characters.

5) Decryption output location
   - Where: in handle_decrypt(), around where output_dir is chosen.
   - What it does:
     - If you leave the output directory blank, it extracts next to the .enc file.
   - How to change:
     - You can set a fixed default folder (for example, your home directory)
       by changing the line that sets output_dir when the user input is empty.

6) Command‑line behavior (non‑interactive mode)
   - Where: in main(), the argument parser and the "--no-menu" option.
   - What it does:
     - Right now, the script only supports the menu mode for normal use.
   - How to change:
     - Advanced users can:
       - Add more arguments (for example, --encrypt PATH, --decrypt FILE).
       - Call encrypt_directory() or decrypt_file() directly when those
         arguments are present.

7) Security tuning: KDF_ITERATIONS
   - Where: near the top of file_Encryptor.py.
   - What it does:
     - Controls how many times the password is processed to make the key.
   - How to change:
     - Increasing the number makes brute‑force attacks harder, but also
       makes encryption/decryption slower.
     - If you are on a powerful machine and want more protection, you can
       increase this value.

8) Magic header "PARROTENC1"
   - Where: inside encrypt_directory() and decrypt_file().
   - What it does:
     - Identifies files created by this tool and avoids trying to open
       random files as encrypted archives.
   - How to change:
     - Only if you understand the impact:
       - The same exact header must be used in both encrypt and decrypt.
       - Changing it will make old encrypted files unreadable unless you
         also update decrypt_file() accordingly.

9) Rate limiting settings
   - Where: near the top of file_Encryptor.py (lines 18-19).
   - Constants:
     - MAX_DECRYPT_ATTEMPTS = 5 (maximum failed attempts allowed)
     - RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 3600 (time window in seconds, default: 1 hour)
   - What it does:
     - Protects against brute-force attacks by limiting decryption attempts.
     - Each encrypted file has its own rate limit counter.
     - Failed attempts are tracked in hidden JSON files (`.decrypt_attempts_*.json`).
   - How to change:
     - MAX_DECRYPT_ATTEMPTS: Increase for more lenient limits, decrease for stricter security.
     - RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW: Change the time window (e.g., 1800 for 30 minutes, 7200 for 2 hours).
     - Note: Rate limit files are stored in the same directory as encrypted files.
       They are automatically cleaned up on successful decryption or when old attempts expire.
